# Libary-Project
This is a web application in which you can keep online records in the library (Located in the master branch).

This is a web application with 2 roles - a simple user and a librarian (administrator).

Using your user account you can:
- view the catalog of books in the library
- book available books
- cancel reservation
- sort books by year of publication
- search books by title
The user can also go to his personal page, where the following is displayed:
- books that are currently on hand
- books reserved but not yet issued
- you can edit personal data (name, age, password)
- you can log out
- you can delete your profile

A librarian account provides the same functionality as a user account.
There are also additional features:
- view a list of all users
- edit and delete users
- view books that users have taken
- pick up books from users
- see a list of books reserved by users
- issue reserved books
- add new books
- edit data of books already available in the library.

The SQL code necessary to create the necessary tables can be found in the resources/templates/util
